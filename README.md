# This is a test project

This is a *test project.*


This test project exists to help us set up Git and Github.  

In our second commit, we made a commit message that recorded
our steps for setting up a new project folder, setting the permissions
for the folder and the subfolders and files in that project folder
and sending them up to Github. The [commit message is here](https://github.com/dragonman750/firstrepo/commit/4396d815acfdd97f32358af65cc97b4cca943c23).

# My mom is a cool dude.
## But even she does not get any emojis! Because all emojis are bad.
It's all the fault of the Emoji Movie. It really ruined the whole thing.
